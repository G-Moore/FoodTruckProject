## Food Truck Project

### Overview
 
* Provides users with the ability to enter up to five food trucks. Input is required from a user for the name, type of food and rating.


* Food Truck information can be displayed in three categories. A list of all food trucks, average rating and the highest-rated food truck.

### Concepts

* Welcome users and offer the ability to provide a name, food type and rating for up to 5 food trucks. The user may input quit instead of proving any further names. A numeric id is given to each truck automatically. The program will exit the input truck fields and provide a menu option.


* The program will continuously run a four option menu until the quit option is chosen.

	* First will print out a list of all food trucks previously entered and the fields contained within them(name, type food, rating, id#).  
	* Second option will calculate the average rating for all the food trucks entered into the program. 
	* Third option will print out the highest-rated food truck rating and its name.
	* Fourth option exits the menu and quits the program entirely.


### Technologies Used

* Encapsulation : set fields with strict access modifiers.
* Getters and setters : for providing information to Food Truck variables.
* @Override : generate toString.
* Methods : minimize code run in main.
* Array : instantiate and provide food truck data.
* For loops : iterate through array length to calculate highest and average ratings.
